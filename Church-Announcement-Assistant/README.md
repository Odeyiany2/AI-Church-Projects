# Church Announcement Assistant
This project is aimed at building a church voice assistant that can effectively read out announcements in a natural sounding voice(Nigerian). 
This will enable efficiency and time saving during church service. This project leverages the power of Microsoft Azure Speech Service to convert texts and uploaded documents to audio files.
